This is Module 1 Challenge. The assignment is to improve the codebase of a fully 
functional basic website. Refactor the code to add accessibility to the site and make 
any improvements. In changing the codebase, the appearance of the website should not change.
But if there is something broken then it should be fixed.

The website should look like the following and can be found [here]( https://dbcomps.github.io/urban-octo-telegram-main/).
